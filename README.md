Best Practices for Assignment Submissions
Here are what's expected from each student when submitting solutions for graded assignments.

The most important ingredients that constitute a successful solution for a graded assignment are:
1. Code
2. Report describing your solution
3. Supporting artefacts including input files (as applicable) and output files / output screens (as applicable)
4. Any third-party references you used in constructing the solution


Report
Include your name, roll number and question in the report.
Include a brief description of how you approached the problem and include screenshots too to help support with evidence.

Video
Introduce yourself in the video.
You don't need to do coding in the video. The video could show the run of the code and the result it produces.
Explain the logic (how it works) of your code, and/or the approach you took in constructing the solution.
Please make sure to check the audio after recording the video.
